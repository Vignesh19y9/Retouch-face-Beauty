# Retouch-face-Beauty

This repository mimics some of the face editing functionalites avilable in photo editing tools like photoshop and luminar ai. Following the detection of a face in an image with the dlib package, skin segmentation is performed using the detected landmarks. On the segmented skin regions several operations are done to add smoothness, glow, color tone, texture and lightness.
The variables are -

smoothness : smooth
glow : glowv
color tone : tonev
texture : text
texture : screenv
